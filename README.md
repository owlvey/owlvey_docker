## Getting started

First, run the following command in terminal:

    docker-compose pull

* Important, replace in docker-compose file the "localhost" value to your host ip.

You have to wait while Docker pulls the containers from the Docker Hub: <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/u/owlvey/">Owlvey</a>

Then, run the following command in terminal:

    docker-compose up

Then open your browser to `http://youripindockercomposefile:45000`
